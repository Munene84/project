## Description
# project1
The fwrite function writes a raw data to a file. On success, the function returns the count of the number of items successfully written to the file. On error, it returns a number less than the specified number of items to be written
# project2
The sscanf function would also be useful. It scans the str buffer to try to match the format specifiers in the format string. Additional pointer arguments may be supplied to indicate variables that should be filled with elements found in the str buffer.
# project3
The fgets function reads n characters from stream and writes them to the str buffer. On success, the function returns the same str parameter. If the end-of-file is encountered, a null pointer is returned
